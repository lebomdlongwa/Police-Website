    "There are a few problems with this. One is that the input component cannot be reused separately from the enhanced component. More crucially, if you apply another HOC to EnhancedComponent that also mutates componentDidUpdate, the first HOC’s functionality will be overridden! This HOC also won’t work with function components, which do not have lifecycle methods.",
